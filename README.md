# fosshack
FOSSHack Hackathon at FISAT, Angamaly.

The project aims to collect the news stories from various social endpoints, i.e. Facebook (using its Graph API) and then determine the authenticity of the news snippet based on the accumulated feedback from the users of the application. This could also be used as a wrapper to implement more user-oriented tools.
